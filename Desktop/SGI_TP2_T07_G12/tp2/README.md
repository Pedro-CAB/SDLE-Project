## Project information

- Implemented Features:
  - **Bump mapping**: Applied to the wall textures, providing a more realistic appearance of depth and irregularity.
  - **Mipmapping**: Used for multiple textures in sofa to ensure that texture details scale appropriately with distance.
  - **Video Texture**: Seamlessly integrated into the scene as a moving visual on the TV screen.
  - **LOD**: Demonstrated by the pillow on the bench which transitions between a sphere and a cube based on the viewer's distance, optimizing rendering performance.
  - **Buffer Geometry**:Evident in the design of the pyramid, which uses a geometric approach for a more intricate and performance-efficient model.

- Scene
  - The setting is a stylized living room:
**Skybox**: Enveloping the room with a serene sky, adding depth to the environment.
**Walls**: Textured with a white plaster look, creating a modern and clean aesthetic.
**Floor**: A polished surface that reflects the room's ambient light.
**Furnishings**: Includes a bench, a round table, and a contemporary TV stand, all textured to fit the scene's style.
**Art**: The "Mona Lisa" adds an artistic touch to the modern decor.
**Lighting**: Point lights are placed to simulate natural illumination, with the intention for the TV to serve as the primary light source.

## Issues/Problems

- **NURBS**: Although implemented, NURBS curves were not included in the final scene due to design decisions
- **Primary Light Source**: Our goal was to have the light emanating from the TV serve as the primary light source to create a more dramatic and realistic lighting effect. However, due to time constraints, this was not accomplished to our satisfaction.
